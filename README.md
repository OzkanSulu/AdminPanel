### ADMIN PANEL

### Overview
This is a demo admin panel built with React, Vite, TypeScript, SCSS, and Recharts. The application provides an interactive dashboard that displays key metrics such as total users, total sales, and total visits using graphs and charts. It also includes a navigation menu with essential features, although not all pages have been fully implemented in this demo.

Note: The project is not responsive yet and is intended to be further developed into a fully functional real-life project.
